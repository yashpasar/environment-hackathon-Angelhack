We are using the existing auto encoder model to increase the accuracy and thereby produce a better solution. For this, we operate the model into two halves called encoder and decoder with 2 hidden layers in each model. We also make use of the ELU activation function, and a batch of 18 being run for 10 epochs. The error rate has decreased drastically to 40 with very less time being taken to train the model.
